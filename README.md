GYUDUS
=====

This is the Final Project of Jarvis Jardin and Geoffrey Ganga for Full Sail University.

Gydus is a web application that will navigate users from classroom to classroom in their school. Great for new students who aren't familiar with their campus. Using GYDUS you can input what class you are in, input the classroom you need to get to, and voli√†. You have directions from one class to another; even if the two classrooms are in two different buildings. Other features include Points of interest such as Restrooms and Vending machines, and Save A Spot.
