					<h4>Geoffrey Ganga</h4>
					
		
					<p>My name is Geoffrey Ganga. I was born in Connecticut, raised in Alpharetta, Georgia. I currently live in Winter Park Florida and attend Full Sail University. I will be graduating March 2013 with a bachelors degree in Computer Science. My major is Web Development. I love everything about the web. From the design to whats going on behind the scenes that make your design functional. Majority of the population including me spends most of their time on the internet. So why not study the web and how it works.Outside of developing websites I also enjoy, skateboarding, working out, playing video games, sleeping, and watching movies. My favorite tv shows are "How I met your mother", "White Collar", "Dexter", and "Greek".</p>
